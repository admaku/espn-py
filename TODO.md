Todo:

- Write up issues in Github and assign to myself.
- Run checks to make sure the parameters that people pass are the correct ones. Do validation on it
- Add in checks for the build_url_params function. (i.e. Enable, rostertype, disable, region, etc)
- Fix up my individual classes so that I DRY my code properly. The __init__ can be changed so that 
I don't use the same thing for each class
- Fix up the _headlines_get, _teams_get, etc so that I DRY my code
- Work on getting tox to work correctly.
- Generate Sphinx documentation correctly and integrate with ReadTheDocs.
- Work on getting my testing coverage to be 100%. (py.test --cov=path/to/package --cov-report=term --cov-report=html
)
- Test my package using cheesecake
